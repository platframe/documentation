    h2 Images

    p.
        The #[span.dir images] directory forks into #[span.dir sprite], #[span.dir inline] and
        #[span.dir linked]. This allows for the grouping of image assets based on their respective
        scope and function. While optional, it helps to keep assets organized with #[em subject]
        directories that are children of the aforementioned trio.

            aside structure #[b 6.1]

    h4 Subject groups

    p.
        A #[em subject] directory serves to demarcate our image assets. If the asset is used across
        the project, it gets separated based on its function, otherwise according to the page it's
        used on in the case of #[em inline] images. This helps to make our file system more intuitive
        and speeds up both development and maintenance as less time is spent navigating and managing
        resources.
    p.
        In figure 6.1 #[span.dir sprite] and #[span.dir inline] each contain two subject directories:
        #[span.dir icons] and #[span.dir brand] in the former and #[span.dir home] and
        #[span.dir about] in the latter.

    aside
        h6.i-emoji-hammer-wrench Dev notes
        ul
            li.
                In the case of #[em inline] image groups, it may be beneficial to create further
                division beyond the #[em subject] point in order to make the file system easier to
                navigate and more intelligible. For instance, creating sub-folders that reflect the
                target view's main sections. For example, #[span.dir home] splits into
                #[span.dir hello], #[span.dir story] and #[span.dir thend] which are the
                corresponding sections of the #[span.file index.pug] view in #[span.dir home]
                (refer to templates).

    h3 Sprite

    p.
        #[em Sprites] are home to images that are not confined to a particular section or document
        and are used throughout the project.

    h4 Vector

    p.
        Global SVG's are compiled into sprite sheets. Depening on the intented use of the
        images, you may choose a particular flavour of sprite to be used exclusively or in
        tandem with another.
    p.
        Continuing with the example above, the images in #[span.dir icons] will become part
        of the #[em view] sprite and those contained in #[span.dir brand] will populate the
        #[em symbols] sprite.

    aside
        h6.i-emoji-gear Build notes
        ul
            li.
                The build system determines the required sprite type by looking at the SVG
                container's name. Currently, this can be either "views" or "symbols". Figure 6.1
                shows how we can produce a "view" #[em and] "symbol" sprite for different images in
                the same project by appropriately setting the directory names. Additional
                #[span.dir view] or #[span.dir symbol] folder's SVG's elsewhere in the sprite image
                directory will just be added to the original sprite file of its respective type.
            li.
                Vectors will undergo minification before being included in a sprite sheet.

            li.
                Sprites reduce HTTP lookups and are cacheable.

    h4 Raster

    p.
        Rasters (png, jpg, webp, gif) can be placed in the same #[em subject] directory as
        SVG's, however not within a #[em view] or #[em symbol] folder as these are reserved for
        vectors. Note that the build system does not support sprite creation for rasters. If your
        project requires a raster-based sprite sheet, you can either extend the existing tooling or
        produce it manually and place it in the #[span.dir linked] folder - see below.

    h3 Inline

    p.
        Images with a narrow, document-level scope are often inlined. They should be placed in the
        #[span.dir inline] directory (see figure 6.1). #[i Inline] graphics will not end up in a
        production build as they should be embedded in the development stage.

    aside
        h6.i-emoji-rocket Perf notes
        ul
            li.
                Embedded images will generally improve page load time by reducing server trips.

        ul
            li.
                Inline vectors are minified while rasters will be converted to #[i base64] during a
                development build.

    h3 Linked

    p.
        Some situations may call for a graphic to be made available as a discrete asset that can be
        cached and referenced by means of a URL. To earmark graphics for linking, group them in the
        #[span.dir linked] directory (fig. 6.1).

    aside
        h6.i-emoji-gear Build notes
        ul
            li.
                Linked graphics of the SVG and PNG formats will be minified on running a development
                or production build.
