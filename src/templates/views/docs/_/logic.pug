            aside structure #[b 5.1]

    p.
        Scripted functionality is contained in #[span.dir logic]. While it is set up for JavaScript
        development by default, it may also be used to house logic from other languages (Fig. 5.1).

    h3 JavaScript

    p.
        Your project's JavaScript is managed from the #[span.dir js] directory. Its immediate
        children are #[span.file root.js], #[span.dir libs] and #[span.dir modules].

    h4 Root

    .explain.code

        .js

            pre
                code.language-javascript.

                    // general functionality
                    import { function } from 'modules/module';

                    // component logic
                    import header from 'headers/1/_';

                    // external package from node_modules
                    import 'fancylib';

                    // manage execution
                    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
                        header();
                    });

            aside root.js #[b 5.2]

    p.
        As the main entry point for your app's JavaScript, #[span.file root.js] consume both the
        project's own logic as well as #[abbr(title="Node Package Manager") NPM] dependencies,
        permitting that they use the standard (ES6) module syntax. While Platframe does not support
        idiosyncratic methods like #[em CommonJS] out of the box, it
        #[a(href="//www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-commonjs") can be enabled].

                #[i Babel] will transpile your JS/ES6 with respect to the configuration in
                #[span.file .browserslistrc], located in the root of your project. It's populated
                with some defaults but may need modification to cover your app's target environments.
            li.
                #[i Rollup] bundles #[span.file root.js] as an
                #[abbr(title="immediately-invoked function expression") IIFE] into a single
                client-side dependency. It is loaded via a #[i defer] directive in
                #[span.file head.pug] but could be moved to the #[a(href="#templates-body") footer]
                block in #[span.file body.pug] if needed.

    h4 Libs

    p.
        The #[span.dir libs] folder is a direct child of the parent language directory and contain
        the respective native (#[span.dir int]) and 3#[sup rd] party libraries (#[span.dir ext])
        that your app consumes.

        ul
            li.
                The framework does not rely on or include any external #[em client-side] libraries.
                Consider them with respect to your project.

    h5 Internal

    p.
        The native library is made up by a collection of utility modules contained in
        #[span.dir int] (fig. 5.1). They are separated by type and consist of low-level, "atomic"
        functionality that essentially derives its usefulness from being part of larger compilations.
        They serve to make your code #[abbr(title="Don't Repeat Yourself") DRY] by being shared
        between higher level functionality in #[span.dir modules] and #[span.dir components].
        Utilities may also be interdependant.

    h5 External

    p.
        #[span.dir ext] contains your project's external (3#[sup rd] party), client-side libraries
        that are not provisioned with a package manager like
        #[abbr(title="Node Package Manager") NPM].

    h4 Modules

    p.
        Logic that are neither part of a component nor qualify as a simple utility should be placed
        in #[span.dir modules]. You decide how modules are structured as it may depend on factors
        beyond the framework's reach, such as the development pattern in use and the scale of your
        project.

    aside
        h6 &#128736; Dev notes
        ul
            li.
                One way of keeping #[span.dir modules] organized and navigable is to separate code
                into individual files based on their general functionality. Naturally,
                the smaller each file's domain, the more partitions (files) you'll have so, decide
                on a scope that works for you / your team. Note that this will also determine how
                you export your module's functionality, i.e. #[i default] for a single module or
                #[i named] for a collection of modules that shares type.
            li.
                Keep in mind that scripts may at first be placed in #[span.dir modules] and then at
                a later stage be pulled out and refactored as part of a new component.
