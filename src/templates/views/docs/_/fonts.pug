    p.
        Fonts are contained in the #[span.dir fonts] folder and managed from the #[em fonts] module 
        in #[span.dir style]. By default the framework is setup to work with a typography 
        #[abbr(title="Content Delivery Network") CDN] in production. This means that the #[em local] 
        type assets contained in #[span.dir fonts] are to be included for development purposes only 
        and are not transfered to the production build. This avoids potential connectivity issues 
        that slows down development.
        
    p.
        If your project makes use of custom fonts, modify #[span.file head.pug] to configure your 
        provider. Platframe uses #[a(href="https://fonts.google.com/") Google&trade; Fonts] as 
        the default font service in production.
